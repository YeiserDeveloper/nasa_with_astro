# Welcome to Nasa API project - with [Astro](https://astro.build)

> 🧑‍🚀 **Seasoned astronaut**

## ⚡ My processes

1. I started by creating the files and folders I would use and starting my repository setup.

2. Then look for the API that is in: [{ NASA APIs }](https://api.nasa.gov/), since you enter they only ask you; your name and surname and your email. Since you give it to them, they return your key.

3. After doing tests with the API and since I knew what I would do, start with the components that will have the API parameters.

4. To conclude, I made the styles with SASS/SCSS because it is faster for me (It should be noted that if you want to use native CSS there is no problem).

## 🔥 What I learned

1. I reinforced what I knew about how to consume an API and print it on the screen.

2. How to use astro and change a project from scratch.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src/
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       ├── index.astro
│       └── global.css
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro`, `.md` or `.css` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal or powershell:
